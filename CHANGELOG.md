0.376.6 - 2024-03-28

This release fixes mypy errors, updates linters, and added docs about `JwtSchema`.

Fix bug in removal of JWT prefix.
In the current implementation if a token happens to contain any trailing J, W or T chars they are also removed.

0.374.3 - 2023-04-06
--------------------

Correctly pluralizes the "UserStatus" model as "User statuses" in Django Admin.

Achieved by overriding the `Meta` (Django model subclass) attribute `verbose_name_plural`.
